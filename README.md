# Real-Time NLP Chatbot with Emotional Intelligence

This repository contains the code for a real-time, context-aware chatbot that can detect user emotions and respond empathetically. The chatbot leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and emotion detection techniques, making it useful for applications such as customer service, mental health support, and social interactions.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection:** Uses sentiment and emotion analysis to detect the user's emotional state.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Built with powerful NLP models such as GPT-2 for generating human-like responses.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Provides instant feedback and responses in real time.
- **Customizable Applications:** Can be adapted for various use cases, including customer service, mental health chatbots, or even personal assistants.

## Key Technologies

- **NLP Models:** GPT-2 (Hugging Face Transformers) for text generation.
- **Emotion Detection:** DistilRoBERTa emotion classifier for analyzing the sentiment and emotion of user inputs.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `transformers`: For GPT-2 and emotion classification models.
  - `torch`: For working with PyTorch models.
